# STATE.md

Living snapshot of project state. Update this whenever you finish a meaningful chunk of work —
this is what an agent (or you) reads first when resuming.

_Last updated: 2026-09-16_

## Known gaps

- `shap`/`chromadb` need Microsoft C++ Build Tools to install natively on Windows (Python 3.13
  has no prebuilt wheels yet) — works fine inside Docker (`make up`). See
  [ml-service/AGENTS.md](ml-service/AGENTS.md).
- `springdoc-openapi` Spring-Boot-4 compatibility unverified — not added to `backend/pom.xml`
  yet. See [backend/AGENTS.md](backend/AGENTS.md).
- No `LICENSE` file yet — open decision, not yet made.
- `tests/e2e` browsers not installed yet (`npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`,
  one-time) — smoke test scaffold works, hasn't been run against a live `make up` stack yet.

## Done

- Repo scaffolded: monorepo structure (`frontend/`, `backend/`, `ml-service/`), docs,
  agent-context files (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`STATE.md`/`HANDOFF.md`), Docker Compose,
  Makefile, CI skeleton.
- `backend` (Spring Boot 4.1.1) compiles, with `CorrelationIdFilter`, `GlobalExceptionHandler`
  (shared error shape), and a Flyway baseline migration.
- `ml-service` (FastAPI) has a working `/health` and stub `/agent/diagnose` endpoint,
  correlation-ID middleware — `pytest` passes.
- `frontend` (React 19 + Vite) scaffolded, `npm install` done.
- Governance layer: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/DISCLAIMER.md`,
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- **12 agentic-engineering competencies implemented** (see `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry
  "Implemented CodeWalnut's 12 agentic-engineering competencies" for the full list):
  guardrail hooks + deny rules, `docs/specs/` + M1 spec, `docs/REPO_MAP.md`, Vitest +
  Playwright wired and passing, `retrospective` skill, Mermaid diagrams, real pre-commit
  hook, explicit code-review + token-economics guidance.

## In Progress

- Nothing yet — scaffold just created.

## Not Started

- M1: Data collection + baseline XGBoost model (`ml-service/`)
- M2: FastAPI inference endpoints
- M3: Spring Boot domain model + Flyway migrations
- M4: React symptom-intake UI
- M5: LangGraph agent wiring (intake → predict → explain)
- M6: RAG knowledge base (Chroma)
- M7: Notifications (email/WhatsApp free tier)
- M8: Deployment (free-tier hosting)

Full roadmap: [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Key Decisions

See [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the full log. Summary:

- Polyglot split: Java (Spring Boot) for backend/business logic, Python (FastAPI + LangGraph)
  for ML/agent, React for UI — matches existing skills, keeps ML ecosystem in Python.
- Free/open-source only: Ollama (local LLM) or free API tiers, Chroma (vector DB), Flyway
  (migrations), free-tier hosting (Render/Railway/Vercel/Supabase).
- Agent orchestration lives in `ml-service` (LangGraph is Python-native); Java stays a
  conventional REST backend that calls into it.
